# Career Pathway Navigator

An intelligent career guidance system that analyzes skill gaps, identifies trending industry skills, and recommends personalized learning paths through micro-credentials and online courses.

## 🚀 Features
- **Industry Trend Analysis**: Scrapes job market data to identify trending skills across various tech roles
- **Skill Gap Detection**: Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to compare user skills with job requirements
- **Micro-Credential Recommendations**: Suggests relevant Coursera courses to bridge skill gaps
- **Multi-User Support**: Processes multiple user profiles in batch
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed career pathway analysis with actionable insights

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

### 1. IndustryTrendAnalyzer
- Analyzes job market data for specific career goals
- Extracts and ranks trending skills by frequency
- Provides market intelligence for career planning

### 2. GapDetectionAgent
- Compares user skills with job requirements using NLP techniques
- Calculates skill match scores using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Identifies missing skills that need development

### 3. MicroCredentialAdvisor
- Recommends relevant online courses from Coursera
- Maps missing skills to appropriate learning resources
- Provides course URLs and descriptions for easy access

### 4. CareerPathwayNavigator
- Orchestrates the entire analysis workflow
- Processes user profiles and generates comprehensive reports
- Saves results in structured JSON format

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Python Libraries
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas scikit-learn nltk
```

### NLTK Data
The script automatically downloads required NLTK data:
- `punkt` (tokenization)
- `stopwords` (text preprocessing)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone or Download the Project
```bash
# Download the career_pathway.py file
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas scikit-learn nltk
```

### 3. Prepare User Profiles
Create a `user_profiles.json` file or let the script generate a default one:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "skills": ["Python", "Data Analysis"],
        "career_goal": "Data Scientist"
    },
    {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "skills": ["Java", "SQL", "Git"],
        "career_goal": "Software Engineer"
    }
]
```

### 4. Run the Analysis
```bash
python career_pathway.py
```

### 5. View Results
- Console output shows detailed analysis for each user
- `career_pathways.json` contains structured results for further processing

    "description": "Manage deployment pipelines and cloud infrastructure."
}
```

### Adding New Courses
Extend the `mock_coursera_courses` array with new learning resources:

```python
{
    "title": "Docker and Kubernetes Course",
    "skills": ["Docker", "Kubernetes", "DevOps"],
    "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/docker-kubernetes",
    "description": "Master containerization and orchestration."
}
```
